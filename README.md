A JavaScript &amp; HTML5 Sampler/Sequencer

This iteration of the beetmachine was created / written for lecture at Durham's The Iron Yard code school front-end cohort.

It's comprised of a few backbone views, foundation template and html5 boilerplate.

Drag and drop samples (wav file) onto any of the pads.
use `u`-`o`, `j`-`l`, `m`-`.`, on the keyboard to control the pads.
